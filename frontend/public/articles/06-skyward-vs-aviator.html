            </table>

            <h3>What the 1% Difference Means</h3>
            <p>While 1% seems small, over significant play it adds up:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>$1,000 wagered:</strong> $40 expected loss in Skyward vs $30 in Aviator</li>
                <li><strong>$10,000 wagered:</strong> $400 expected loss in Skyward vs $300 in Aviator</li>
                <li><strong>$100,000 wagered:</strong> $4,000 expected loss in Skyward vs $3,000 in Aviator</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Perspective</h4>
                <p>While Aviator has a mathematical advantage in terms of RTP, both games still have negative expected value for players. The 1% difference matters more to high-volume players than casual players.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="gameplay">
            <h2>Gameplay Differences</h2>

            <h3>Core Mechanics</h3>

                <li>Multiplier increases during the round</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Multiplier Behavior</h3>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Important Reminder</h4>
                <p>Both games are gambling products with negative expected value. Neither is a "better choice" for making money because both guarantee losses over time. The following considerations are about preference, not profitability.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Consider Skyward If:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You want a fresh alternative to Aviator</li>
                <li>You prefer the balloon/sky aesthetic</li>
                <li>You want a calmer visual experience</li>
                <li>The 10,000x max multiplier appeals to you</li>
                <li>You play at casinos featuring 1x2 Gaming</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Consider Aviator If:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You prefer the higher 97% RTP</li>
                <li>You want the established player community</li>
                <li>You prefer the aviation theme</li>
                <li>You want widespread casino availability</li>
                <li>You value the dual bet feature</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mathematical Comparison Summary</h3>
            <p>From a purely mathematical standpoint:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aviator's 97% RTP vs Skyward's 96% means Aviator loses you $1 less per $100 wagered</li>
                <li>For casual players, this difference is minimal</li>
                <li>For high-volume players, Aviator offers slightly better theoretical value</li>
                <li>Both games will result in expected losses over time</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>Is Skyward a copy of Aviator?</h3>

            <h3>Can strategies from Aviator work in Skyward?</h3>
