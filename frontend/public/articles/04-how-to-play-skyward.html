            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our comprehensive guide on how to play <strong>Skyward</strong>, the exciting balloon-themed crash game developed by <strong>1x2 Gaming</strong>. Whether you're completely new to crash games or looking to understand Skyward specifically, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Before You Begin</h4>
                <p>Skyward is a casino game involving real money. Never gamble with money you cannot afford to lose. This guide is for educational purposes only and does not encourage gambling. The house always has a mathematical edge.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="game-overview">
            <h2>Game Overview</h2>
            <p>Skyward is a <strong>crash game</strong> - a type of casino game where a multiplier increases from 1x and can "crash" at any random moment. The objective is simple: cash out before the crash happens.</p>

            <h3>Key Game Information</h3>
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Game Name:</strong></td>
                        <td>Skyward</td>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Game Type:</strong></td>
                        <td>Crash Game</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Theme:</strong></td>
                        <td>Balloon/Sky</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>RTP:</strong></td>
                        <td>96%</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Max Multiplier:</strong></td>

            <h3>The Core Concept</h3>
            <p>In Skyward, you'll see a balloon that rises into the sky. As it rises, a multiplier increases. The higher it goes, the bigger your potential win. But at any moment, the balloon can pop (crash), ending the round. If you haven't cashed out by then, you lose your bet.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="step-by-step">
            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Playing Skyward</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Place Your Bet</h3>
            <div class="step-box">
                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Before each round, there's a betting window (usually a few seconds). During this time:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose your bet amount using the + and - buttons or by typing directly</li>
                    <li>Click the "Bet" or "Place Bet" button to confirm</li>
                    <li>Wait for the round to begin</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Start with small bets while you're learning the game mechanics.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 2: Watch the Balloon Rise</h3>
            <div class="step-box">
                <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Once the round starts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The colorful balloon begins ascending into the sky</li>
                    <li>The multiplier starts at 1.00x and increases as the balloon rises</li>
                    <li>The higher the balloon goes, the faster the multiplier increases</li>
                    <li>Other players' bets and cash-outs may be visible on screen</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Decide When to Cash Out</h3>
            <div class="step-box">
                <p><strong>The crucial decision:</strong> This is where the game gets exciting. You must decide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cash out early for a smaller, safer win</li>
                    <li>Hold longer for a potentially bigger multiplier</li>
                    <li>Risk losing everything if the balloon pops</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Click the "Cash Out" button at any time to secure your win.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 4: Collect or Lose</h3>
            <div class="step-box">
                <p><strong>Two possible outcomes:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If you cash out in time:</strong> Your bet is multiplied by the current multiplier. Bet $10 and cash out at 3x = $30 return ($20 profit)</li>
                    <li><strong>If the balloon pops before you cash out:</strong> You lose your entire bet for that round</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 5: Repeat</h3>
            <div class="step-box">
                <p>After each round, a new betting window opens, and you can choose to bet again or sit out.</p>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li>See other players' bets in real-time</li>
                <li>Watch when others cash out</li>

        <section id="tips">
            <h2>Tips for New Players</h2>

            <h3>1. Start Small</h3>
            <p>Begin with minimum bets while learning. This limits your losses while you understand the game mechanics.</p>

            <h3>2. Set a Budget</h3>
            <p>Before playing, decide how much you're willing to lose. Never exceed this amount, regardless of results.</p>

            <h3>3. Use Demo Mode First</h3>
            <p>If available, play the demo version with virtual currency to practice without risking real money.</p>

            <h3>4. Understand the Odds</h3>
            <p>Know that approximately 50% of rounds crash below 2x. High multipliers are exciting but rare.</p>

            <h3>5. Don't Chase Losses</h3>
            <p>If you lose several rounds, don't increase bets to recover. This often leads to bigger losses.</p>

            <h3>6. Set Win Limits Too</h3>
            <p>It's not just about loss limits. If you win a decent amount, consider stopping to secure those gains.</p>

            <h3>7. Remember the House Edge</h3>
            <p>The 4% house edge means the casino will profit over time. Play for entertainment, not profit.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="mistakes">
            <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

            <h3>Mistake 1: Believing in Patterns</h3>
            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> "The last 5 rounds crashed early, so the next one will go high."</p>
            <p><strong>The reality:</strong> Each round is independent. Past results don't affect future outcomes.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 2: Chasing Losses</h3>
            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Increasing bets after losses to recover money.</p>
            <p><strong>The reality:</strong> This often accelerates losses and can be financially devastating.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 3: Playing Without Limits</h3>
            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Not setting budget or time limits.</p>
            <p><strong>The reality:</strong> Without limits, it's easy to lose more than intended.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 4: Waiting Too Long to Cash Out</h3>
            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Always holding for big multipliers.</p>
            <p><strong>The reality:</strong> High multipliers are rare; most rounds crash at lower values.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 5: Gambling Under the Influence</h3>
            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Playing while drinking alcohol or using substances.</p>
            <p><strong>The reality:</strong> Impaired judgment leads to poor decisions and larger losses.</p>
