            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Gambling, including playing crash games like Skyward, carries inherent risks. This guide provides comprehensive information about responsible gambling practices, warning signs of problem gambling, and resources for those who need help.</p>

            <div class="key-message">
                <h3>The Most Important Message</h3>
                <p><strong>Gambling should only ever be entertainment with money you can completely afford to lose.</strong> It should never be seen as a way to make money, solve financial problems, or escape from life's challenges.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="house-edge">
            <h2>Understanding the House Edge</h2>

            <h3>The Mathematical Reality</h3>
            <p>Before discussing responsible gambling, it's crucial to understand why gambling always costs money over time:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Skyward's RTP is 96%:</strong> For every $100 wagered, $4 goes to the casino on average</li>
                <li><strong>This is not variable:</strong> No strategy, skill, or timing can change this</li>
                <li><strong>It's by design:</strong> Casinos are businesses designed to profit</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What This Means for You</h3>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Total Wagered</th>
                        <th>Expected Loss (4%)</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>$100</td>
                        <td>$4</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>$1,000</td>
                        <td>$40</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>$10,000</td>
                        <td>$400</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>$100,000</td>
                        <td>$4,000</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The longer you play and the more you bet, the more you will lose. There are no exceptions to this mathematical reality.</p>

            <h2>Gambling Myths Debunked</h2>

            <h3>Myth: "I can win money gambling if I play smart"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> The house edge is mathematical and cannot be overcome with any strategy. The casino always has the advantage.</p>

            <h3>Myth: "I'm due for a win after losing"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> This is the gambler's fallacy. Each game is independent; past results don't influence future outcomes.</p>

            <h3>Myth: "Gambling problems only happen to other people"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Problem gambling can affect anyone regardless of intelligence, income, or background.</p>

            <h3>Myth: "I can always stop when I want to"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Problem gambling is characterized by loss of control. Many people believe they can stop until they realize they can't.</p>

            <h3>Myth: "It's only a problem if I can't afford it"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Problem gambling isn't just about money. It affects mental health, relationships, and quality of life.</p>

            <h3>Myth: "I just need one big win to solve my problems"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> This thinking leads to deeper problems. Even big wins are typically gambled away by those with gambling problems.</p>
