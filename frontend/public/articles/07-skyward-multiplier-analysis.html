            <h2>Introduction to Multipliers</h2>
            <p>The <strong>multiplier</strong> in Skyward is the core mechanic that determines potential winnings. As the balloon rises, the multiplier increases from 1.00x until the balloon pops (crashes). Understanding how multipliers are distributed helps set realistic expectations.</p>

            <h3>Key Multiplier Facts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Starting Point:</strong> All rounds begin at 1.00x</li>
                <li><strong>Maximum:</strong> 10,000x (the highest possible multiplier)</li>
                <li><strong>Minimum Crash:</strong> Instant crash at 1.00x is possible</li>
                <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Designed to achieve 96% RTP over time</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="how-multipliers-work">
            <h2>How Multipliers Work in Skyward</h2>

            <h3>The Multiplier Formula</h3>
            <p>In crash games, the multiplier is typically calculated using an exponential formula. While the exact formula used in Skyward is proprietary, the general model follows:</p>

            <div class="formula-box">
                <p><strong>Multiplier = e^(rate x time)</strong></p>
                <p>Where the crash point is determined by a random number generator.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How the Crash Point is Determined</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Before the round starts, a cryptographic seed is generated</li>
                <li>This seed determines the crash point (unknown to all until crash)</li>
                <li>The multiplier increases until reaching the predetermined crash point</li>
                <li>The game is provably fair - results can be verified after each round</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Your Win Calculation</h3>
            <p>If you cash out successfully:</p>
            <div class="formula-box">
                <p><strong>Winnings = Bet Amount x Cash Out Multiplier</strong></p>
                <p>Example: $10 bet cashed out at 5.00x = $50 return ($40 profit)</p>
            </div>

        <section id="probability-distribution">
            <h2>Probability Distribution</h2>

            <h2>The 10,000x Maximum Multiplier</h2>
            <p>Skyward's maximum multiplier of <strong>10,000x</strong> is its theoretical ceiling. Here's what you need to know:</p>

            <h3>Probability Analysis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Probability:</strong> Approximately 0.01% (1 in 10,000 rounds)</li>
                <li><strong>If you bet $10 and hit 10,000x:</strong> $100,000 return</li>
                <li><strong>Expected wait time:</strong> Playing 60 rounds/hour, statistically every ~166 hours</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reality Check</h3>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>The Mathematical Trap</h4>
                <p>While 10,000x sounds incredible, consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll statistically lose 9,999 bets for every max multiplier reached</li>
                    <li>At $10/bet, you'd spend $99,990 to potentially win $100,000</li>
                    <li>The house edge ensures you'll lose $4,000 of that $100,000 wagered (4%)</li>
                    <li>Variance means you might never hit it in your lifetime</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Maximum Multiplier Myths</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> "The max multiplier is due after many low rounds"</li>
                <li><strong>Reality:</strong> Each round is independent. Previous results don't affect future probabilities.</li>

                <li>Wins are more substantial when they occur</li>

            <h2>Multiplier Myths Debunked</h2>

            <h3>Myth 1: "A big multiplier is due"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Each round is independent. Probability doesn't change based on history. After 100 low rounds, the probability of the next round being high is unchanged.</p>

            <h3>Myth 2: "High multipliers come in clusters"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Random distributions naturally create apparent clusters. This is normal statistical variation, not a pattern to exploit.</p>

            <h3>Myth 3: "Tracking multipliers helps prediction"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> No amount of data tracking can predict future outcomes. The random number generator has no memory.</p>

            <h3>Myth 4: "Low cash outs are safer"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> While you win more often, you win less per win. The expected loss (4%) remains identical.</p>

            <h3>Myth 5: "The game adjusts multipliers based on player behavior"</h3>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Provably fair systems determine crash points before bets are placed. The game cannot adjust based on bets.</p>

        <section id="faq">
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>What's the most common multiplier in Skyward?</h3>
            <p>The most common range is 1.00x to 2.00x, with approximately 52% of all rounds crashing within this range. The single most common crash point is below 1.5x.</p>

            <h3>How often does Skyward reach 100x?</h3>
            <p>Statistically, multipliers of 100x or higher occur in approximately 1% of rounds (1 in 100).</p>

            <h3>Can I increase my chances of catching high multipliers?</h3>
            <p>No. The probability is fixed by the game's algorithm. You can only choose whether to bet and when to cash out.</p>

            <h3>Is there a best time to play for better multipliers?</h3>
            <p>No. The RNG operates independently of time, player count, or any external factors. Every round has identical probability distributions.</p>

            <h3>Why do I see different multipliers than other tracking sites show?</h3>
            <p>Different sessions produce different results due to variance. Long-term averages converge, but short-term results vary widely.</p>
