        <section id="balloon-theme">
            <h2>The Balloon Theme Innovation</h2>

            <h3>Why a Balloon?</h3>
            <p>The balloon theme was a deliberate creative choice that differentiates Skyward from competitors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Visual metaphor:</strong> A balloon naturally rises and can pop - perfect for crash mechanics</li>
                <li><strong>Universal appeal:</strong> Balloons are universally recognized and non-threatening</li>
                <li><strong>Calmer aesthetic:</strong> Less aggressive than planes or rockets</li>
                <li><strong>Unique identity:</strong> Stands out in a market of aviation-themed games</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Thematic Elements</h3>
            <p>Skyward's balloon theme influences various aspects of the game:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rising animation through sky layers</li>
                <li>Cloud-filled backgrounds</li>
                <li>The "pop" crash event</li>
                <li>Color scheme (blues, whites, vibrant balloon colors)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Psychological Considerations</h3>
            <p>The balloon theme may have different psychological impacts compared to other themes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Less sense of urgency than fast-moving planes</li>
                <li>More whimsical, less intense atmosphere</li>
                <li>Appeals to players seeking a different aesthetic</li>
            </ul>
